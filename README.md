# Prysm

### Minimum Viable Product
Prysm will be a Chrome extension that allows a user to filter a web page using 1 of 8 different filters. These filters are designed to simulate different types of color-blindness, allowing the user to view a website through the eyes of a color-blind user. Developers, for example, can utilize the extension to engineer their siteâ€™s UI/UX.
