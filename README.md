# Prism

### Minimum Viable Product
Prism will be a Chrome extension that allows a user to filter a web page using 1 of 8 different filters. These filters are designed to simulate different types of color-blindness, allowing the user to view a website through the eyes of a color-blind user. Developers, for example, can utilize the extension to engineer their siteâ€™s UI/UX.

- [ ] Chrome extension
- [ ] 8 filters to use
- [ ] Clears a filter
- [ ] Changes photos and text
- [ ] Options to just do text/just photos/whole site
- [ ] Material Design

### Technologies
Our Chrome extension will be implemented using: jQuery, HTML, and CSS. We will have one script fill that has the logic to find all the DOM elements that need to be changed. There will also be one CSS file that holds all the filters being applied to the webpage.
