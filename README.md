# Prism

![screenshot](docs/screenshot.png)

Prism is a Chrome extension that simulates color-blindness when browsing the web. Users are able to select one of four different types of color-blindness in two degrees each (e.g., Protanopia and Protanomaly), effectively filtering all text, images, videos, backgrounds, and buttons on the current page.

The extension utilizes the following:

- Vanilla JavaScript
- jQuery
- HTML and CSS
- Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)

# Features

Current features of the Prism include:

- [X] An open-source Chrome extension
- [X] Eight selectable filters to simulate a particular type of color-blindness
- [X] Detailed previews and descriptions of each color-blindness
- [X] Storage of the previously-chosen filter
- [X] An on/off switch

# Functionality

<!-- First, an SVG script containing all color filters is injected directly into the page. These filters are represented by the Color Matrix Library, whose values are customized to simulate a particular type of color-blindness (e.g., Deuteranopia, Deuteranomaly, etc.).

As a user selects a type of color-blindness, Prism modifies the page by calling CSSâ€™ built-in filter property, which provides graphical effects to elements of the page. Using a url value that points to the user-selected filter from the SVG script, Prism then applies styling to all elements of the page: text, images, videos, backgrounds, and buttons alike. -->
